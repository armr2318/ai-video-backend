# AI Video Generator Backend (Node.js, Serverless)

Serverless backend for an AI-powered video/GIF generator using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.  
Currently returns mocked or pre-uploaded S3 video URLs for development and testing.

---

##  Architecture

- API Gateway (HTTP API) with a `/generate` POST route  
- AWS Lambda (Node.js 18.x) parses prompt and returns fake or pre-uploaded S3 media URL  
- S3 bucket holds test videos or GIFs (or use signed URLs later)  
- Designed to stay within AWS Free Tier  

---

##  Setup & Deployment

### ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with credentials  
- AWS SAM CLI installed  
- Node.js 18.x installed  
- An S3 bucket (e.g. `ai-video-generator-yourname`) â€” see [S3 Setup](#s3-setup)

###  Build & Deploy

```bash
sam build
sam deploy --guided

    Accept defaults, or customize the stack name

    Use the same region as your S3 bucket and Lambda function

 Local Testing
Invoke Lambda with Sample Event

sam local invoke GenerateFunction --event events/event.json

Unit Testing

npm install
npm test

 API Usage
Endpoint

POST to your deployed API Gateway /generate endpoint.

Example request:

{
  "prompt": "Alien crash lands in Arizona"
}

Example curl:

curl -X POST https://YOUR_API_ID.execute-api.YOUR_REGION.amazonaws.com/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Alien crash lands in Arizona"}'

Example Response

{
  "prompt": "Alien crash lands in Arizona",
  "prompt_id": "generated123",
  "video_url": "https://your-s3-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/generated123.gif"
}

 S3 Setup

To store or serve demo GIFs:

    Create a bucket (e.g. ai-video-generator-yourname)

    Upload sample .gif files manually

    (Optional) Set public read access or use signed URLs

    Update app.js to use your bucket name

Want to use signed URLs? Ask and weâ€™ll show you how to generate them securely in Lambda.
 Next Steps

    Upload real AI-generated content to S3

    Replace mock URLs with signed URLs

    Add DynamoDB for metadata tracking

    Integrate OpenAI or Bedrock for actual video logic
